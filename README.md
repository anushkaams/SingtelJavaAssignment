# Assignment - Anushka Senarathna


 A 1 b. - By making Animal class abstract and add fly method in to it as an abstract method will improve the maintainability of the code.

 A 3 b  - Rooster is - A chicken with different sing behavior.

 A 3 c  - As implemented in solution composition can be used to model the Rooster object without using inheritance, where we can pass different behaviors using strategy pattern.

 A 4 d -  Since parrot's behavior differentiate with sing methods we can provide multiple implementation for each Singable interface thus we can pass required implementation to 
      parrot object. Also can simply add new parrot sing behavior by extending Singable interface.

 B 3 a - Can pass swimable behavior to the Dolphin object rather inherit it from Fish.

 B 3 b - When we use already implemented concrete classes code duplication will be less

Note - I was able to complete up to the D 2 within the 1 and half hour, I did E question and bonus question after that.

Please note asenarathn and anushkaams both are my github accounts and I used anushkaams one to create the repository, and account configured in my PC is asenarathn, That's why this repo shows two contributors.
